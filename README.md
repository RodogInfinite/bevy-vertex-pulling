# bevy-vertex-pulling

Vertex pulling is a useful and efficient technique for drawing many quads or cubes by storing per-instance data in a buffer, indexing into it using an index calculated based on the vertex index, and calculating offsets from a world position for the instance based on which vertex of the quad/cube is being processed.

## Running quads-instanced example in the browser

### With [Just](https://crates.io/crates/just)
#### Step 1
From the command line and in the directory with the justfile run `just serve` and all of the manual steps noted above will be run in order
#### Step 2
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/generated/quads-instanced.html` in the browser

### Manually from the command line

#### Step 1
`cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --example quads-instanced`
#### Step 2
`wasm-bindgen --out-dir generated --web target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/examples/quads-instanced.wasm`
#### Step 3
`simple-http-server --port 3000 --nocache`
#### Step 4
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/generated/quads-instanced.html` in the browser




## Approaches Implemented

- Instance data stored in:
  - Storage buffer
- Shapes
  - Quads
  - Cuboids/voxels

## Things to do/try

- [ ] Instance data storage
  - [ ] Instance buffer
  - [ ] Texture buffer
  - [ ] Reusable abstraction
- [ ] Reduce overdraw
  - [ ] Depth prepass
  - [ ] Sorting from front to back
  - [ ] Tighter containing geometry
    - [ ] Triangle mesh to draw quads and `discard` like alpha mask
    - [ ] Bevy circular texture with a triangle mesh and `discard` like alpha mask
    - [ ] Bevy circular texture with a circular mesh
- [ ] Support more basic shapes
- [ ] Support complex meshes
- [ ] Billboarding (make the planar shape face the camera)
- [ ] Culling
  - [ ] Compute shader-based frustum culling
  - [ ] Compute shader-based occlusion culling
- [ ] Compute shader software rasterisation when the shape is small on-screen as raster shades fragments using 2x2 'pixel quads'
